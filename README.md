# ðŸŽ¯ Guess The Number Game (Java)

A simple console-based "Guess the Number" game written in Java. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and challenges the user to guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The user is prompted to enter guesses.
- The program gives hints ("Too high", "Too low") until the correct number is guessed.
- It counts and displays the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.

## ðŸ§¾ Example

Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?
Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 68
Congratulations! You guessed the number 68 in 3 attempts.
